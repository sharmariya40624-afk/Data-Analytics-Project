#Heart Disease Prediction
#Project Overview

-This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters.

-The goal is to use data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to assist in early detection of heart-related risks.

#Objectives

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on medical data

2. Identify key factors influencing heart disease

3. Build and train a machine learning classification model

4. Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

#Dataset Information

-The dataset contains medical attributes of patients such as:

1. Age

2. Sex

3. Chest Pain Type

4. Resting Blood Pressure

5. Cholesterol Level

6. Fasting Blood Sugar

7. Maximum Heart Rate

8. Thallium

9. ST Depression

10. Heart Disease


#Tools & Technologies Used

1. Python

2. Pandas (Data manipulation)

3. NumPy (Numerical operations)

4. Matplotlib / Seaborn (Data visualization)

5. Jupyter Notebook

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following analysis was performed:

1. Distribution of target variable

2. Correlation analysis between features

3. Feature relationship with heart disease

4. Data visualization using plots and heatmaps

5. Checking for missing values and outliers

6. EDA helped identify important predictive features such as chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and ST depression.


#Key Insights

-Chest pain type and maximum heart rate are strong indicators of heart disease.

-Certain clinical features show high correlation with the target variable.


#Future Improvements

-Hyperparameter tuning

-Cross-validation

-Deployment using Flask or Streamlit

-Integration with real-time medical systems
