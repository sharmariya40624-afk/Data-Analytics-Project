#Heart Disease Prediction
#Project Overview

This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing heart disease data to identify important patterns and relationships between various health parameters such as age, cholesterol level, maximum heart rate, and presence of heart disease.

The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and visualize meaningful insights that can help in understanding risk factors related to heart disease.

#Technologies Used

-Python

-Pandas

-NumPy

-Matplotlib

-Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

#Dataset Information

The dataset contains medical attributes such as:

-Age

-Sex

-Cholesterol Level

-Resting Blood Pressure

-Maximum Heart Rate (HR)

-Presence/Absence of Heart Disease

#Visualizations Performed
1️. Heart Disease Presence Distribution

Bar chart showing number of patients with and without heart disease.

2.  Age Distribution

Histogram showing distribution of patients across different age groups.

3️. Age vs Cholesterol

Scatter plot showing relationship between age and cholesterol level.

4️. Maximum Heart Rate Distribution

Histogram representing distribution of maximum heart rate values.

#Key Insights

-Middle-aged individuals show higher concentration in the dataset.

-Cholesterol levels vary significantly across age groups.

-Certain age groups show higher chances of heart disease presence.

-Maximum heart rate distribution highlights variation among patients.

#Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

-Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Data cleaning and preprocessing

-Creating visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

-Interpreting patterns and relationships in healthcare data

-Improving analytical and problem-solving skills
